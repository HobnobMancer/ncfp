Description
-----------

``ncfp`` is a program and Python package that, given a set of protein sequences
with appropriate identifier values, retrieves corresponding coding nucleotide
sequences from the ``NCBI nucleotide`` databases. This is useful, for instance,
to help backthread coding sequences onto protein alignments for phylogenetic
analyses.

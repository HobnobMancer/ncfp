About ``ncfp``
==============

``ncfp`` is a program and Python package that, given a set of protein sequences
with appropriate identifier values, retrieves corresponding coding nucleotide
sequences from the ``NCBI nucleotide`` databases. This is useful, for instance, to help backthread coding sequences onto protein
alignments for phylogenetic analyses.
